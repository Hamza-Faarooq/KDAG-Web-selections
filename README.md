1. **App.js**:
   This file serves as the main entry point for our React application. It imports necessary modules from React and Material-UI libraries.
   Within the `App` function component, we define a Material-UI theme using `createMuiTheme`, specifying primary and secondary colors.
   This theme is then applied using the `ThemeProvider` component, which wraps our `CoursePage` component.
   The purpose of this file is to set up the global theme for our application and render the main content, which in this case is the course page.

3. **CoursePage.js**:
   The `CoursePage` component represents the course page of our application.
   It includes styled navigation tabs for different days of the course and dynamically renders content based on the selected day.
   The component uses styled-components to create styled navigation elements (`NavigationContainer` and `NavigationTab`).
   It manages the active day state using React's `useState` hook and provides a function (`handleDayChange`) to update the active day based on user interaction.
   The content for navigation tabs is generated dynamically from the `courseData` array, and the active tab's style changes to indicate the selected day.

5. **CourseSection.js**:
   This file contains the `CourseSection` component, which is responsible for rendering the content sections based on the selected day.
   It receives the active day as a prop (`day`) from the `CoursePage` component and displays sections related to that day.
   The component utilizes styled-components for styling the section container, title, and list items.
   It dynamically renders the sections' titles and descriptions based on the `sectionsData` object, which contains data for each day's sections.

7. **App.css**:
   The `App.css` file contains additional CSS styles used to enhance the appearance and layout of our application.
   It includes styles for the overall body, course page, navigation, sections, and other elements.
   These styles help create a visually appealing and cohesive design for the course page, aligning with the Material-UI theme defined in `App.js`.


These four files work together to create a user-friendly and visually appealing course page within a React application. 
They handle layout, styling, state management, and dynamic content rendering to provide an interactive learning experience for users.

PS; We can use NPM or Yarn to install all the required dependencies. I have used NPM.
